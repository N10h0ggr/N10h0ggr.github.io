Hey there! I’m Noel Carrasco, the person behind this blog. My journey into cybersecurity started out of pure curiosity—what began as a hobby quickly turned into a full-blown passion. I’m the kind of person who loves to dig into the nuts and bolts of how things work, especially when it comes to all that computer security geek stuff.

I'm currently in a role that lets me play both sides of the fence: offense and defense. Whether I’m outsmarting potential threats or figuring out new ways to test system defenses, I’m all in, especially when it involves low-level, technical deep dives. The tougher it gets, the more interested I am.

This blog is my little slice of the internet where I share what I’m learning, explore new ideas, and occasionally rant about the latest trends in cybersecurity. I’m not here to lecture or pretend I have all the answers—this is a space for genuine exploration, conversation, and growth. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, I hope you’ll find something here that sparks your interest.

Outside of work, I’m probably still glued to a screen, either coding or digging into some new security research. But I’ve got to balance all that screen time, so I’m also pretty into sports. It keeps me sharp, both mentally and physically.

Thanks for checking out my blog. Feel free to reach out, share your thoughts, or just say hi.
